										<p>
											The FRC 2021 season, Game Changers, is set to take place in the spring of 2021, but it has been announced that it will be a replay of the FRC 2020 season, Infinite Recharge; 
											the robots created following the 2020 rules will be allowed to play during 2021. Below is my redesign of our 2020 robot, dubbed 'Sentinel'. 
											It incorporates new techniques, solves previous design issues, and incorporate new manufacturing techniques (such as square tubing and riveting).     
										</p>
										<p>
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/gr9/robot-2.png" alt="" ></span>
										</p>
										<p>
											This design builds on my previous one and improves it by adding:
											<ul>
												<li>3 ball intake</li>
												<li>Variable angle turreted shooter</li>
												<li>Telescoping elevator (for climbing)</li>
												<li>Square tubing & riveted construction</li>
											
											</ul>
											As well as still following all the <a href="https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2020/Manual/2020FRCGameSeasonManual.pdf" target="_blank">2020 Infinite Recharge rules</a>.

											However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the robot was never finished and never saw the light of competition.
